            <h3>Networking (Computer Networking):</h3>
            <p>Networking is the way computers and devices connect to share information, like how phones or laptops use Wi-Fi to access the internet or send messages.</p>
            <h3> IoT (Internet of Things):</h3>
            <p>IoT means connecting everyday devices (like fans, lights, or watches) to the internet so they can collect and share data, work automatically, or be controlled remotely.</p>
            <h3>Emerging Technologies:</h3>
            <p>Emerging technologies are new and advanced tools or ideas (like AI, robots, or virtual reality) that are still growing but have the power to change how we live and work.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card2">
            <h1><center>HOW THEY WORK?</center></h1>
            <h3>Networking</h3>
            <p>Networking works by connecting computers and devices so they can share information. Data travels through cables or wirelessly using devices like routers and switches, following specific rules (called protocols) to reach the right destination.</p>
            <h3>IoT</h3>
            <p>IoT works by using smart devices with sensors to collect data (like temperature or motion), which is sent through the internet to apps or cloud systems. Users can then monitor or control these devices remotely using their phones or computers.</p>
            <h3>Emerging Technologies</h3>
            <p>Emerging technologies work by using new and powerful tools like AI, robotics, or virtual reality to solve problems, automate tasks, and improve how we live and work. They often rely on data, advanced software, and smart machines.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card3">
            <h1><center>WHY THEY ARE IMPORTANT?</center></h1>
            <h3>Networking</h3>
            <p>Networking is important because it allows computers, phones, and devices to connect, share information, access the internet, and communicate with each other easily and quickly.</p>
            <h3>IOT</h3>
            <p>IoT is important because it makes everyday devices smart, allowing them to collect data, work automatically, and be controlled from anywhere â€” which saves time, energy, and improves convenience.</p>
            <h3>Emerging Technologies</h3>
            <p>Emerging technologies are important because they bring new ways to solve problems, make life easier, create smarter systems, and drive innovation in areas like health, education, business, and communication</p>
